# at-someone
```Discord added and then removed the @someone feature. Let's bring it back!```

## Software I'm going to use
* JavaScript (NodeJS)
  * DiscordJS
* Jekyll

## Plan
The plan is to make a bot that when pinged pings a random user in the server. We can make a simple website to go with it. This is a project that's destined mainly to teach how to use Discordjs and other NPM libraries.
